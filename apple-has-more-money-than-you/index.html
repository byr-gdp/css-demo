		Apple has more money than you.
	</h1>

	<div class="box">
		<p>
			Since the launch of the iPhone 6s in the UK on the 25th September 2015 at 8.00AM, Apple has sold:
		</p>
		<p class="data">
			2,564,777
		</p>
		<p>
			iPhones
		</p>

	</div>

	<div class="box">
		<p>
			This has generated Apple roughly:
		</p>
		<p class="data">
			£1,587,645,777
		</p>
		<p>
			Only from iPhones, Only in the UK.
		</p>
	</div>
	<small>
		These approximate figures are based on Apple's Q3 results showing the sale of 6 iPhones every second. The figures do not take into account pre-orders, so add another £10M for good measure.
